Machine learning process

Collect training data
Train a "classifier"
Make Predictions

The data has multiple lines (rows or examples) and each line has multiple
columns. These columns are called features.
e.g housing data: has data for multiple houses and 
each house data can have features like sqft, number of rooms etc.
And one of the columns (usually the last column) is a value that must be predicted
for new data (its called label).
For existing data, that column is the known value that 
will be used for training.
